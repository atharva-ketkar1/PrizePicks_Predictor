## NBA Finals – 6/22/2025: OKC vs Indiana Game 7

### Model 1 Predictions(predict_lines.py -> predictions_2025-06-21.csv)

- Went 2/3 (Would've gone 3/4 because Tyrese had 9 pts in 7 minutes, but he tore his Achilles, hopefully he has a speedy recovery)

### Model 2 Predictions(predict_lines_v2.py -> predictions_2025-06-21_v2.csv)

- Went 6/8 (When Tyrese tore his achilles he had 0 assists, so the line probably wouldn't have hit. Can't tell for sure though)
